# Arduino Library
With the Arduino Ethernet Controller the user is able to control a microcontroler over a simple HTTP request. Itâ€™s possible to send commands over Notification-Center and the app itself.

To make programming as easy as possible, we decided to write a Library for the Arduino Programming environment.
The library has to be copied in your Arduino library directory.

A example sketch is located in the AEC library folder under examples. It contains all methods and shows you how they are used.
The sketch is well commented and easy to understand.

# iPhone App

[Arduino Ethernet Controller PRO](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/arduino-ethernet-controller/id989487043) and [Arduino Ethernet Controller](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/arduino-ethernet-controller/id908382414) are the counterparts to the API.  
With the app you are able to control your Arduino over the network. 
Simply add your Arduino to your control, insert the commands and you are ready to go.
